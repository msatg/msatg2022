# Mid-South Algebraic Topology and Geometry Workshop

Online  July 18-20th, 2022

## Motivation and Introduction

The algebraic topology and algebraic geometry in China are still developing, especially in the mid-south area. We hope we can help developing the math areas as much as we can. This is the first “Mid-South Algebraic Topology and Geometry Workshop”(华中南代数拓扑几何研讨会) that we organize. We plan to organize a 1-2 days workshop every quarter and a 3-5 days worshop every year. HUST and SCUT also have online joint undergraduate seminars in algebraic topology and algebraic geometry.
If you are interested in giving a talk in one of the MSATG workshops, or you would like to give us some comments, feel free to contact us.
